objects and Classes in Java

objects=
AnA Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state.

The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior. Objects are created at runtime from templates, which are also known as classes.

class=
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
A class in Java can contain:
    ->Fields
    ->Methods
    ->Constructors
    ->Blocks
    ->Nested class and interface
